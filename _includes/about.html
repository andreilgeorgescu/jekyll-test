    I'm a software engineer and the founder of Rock the JVM. I started the
    Rock the JVM project out of love for Scala and the technologies it powers
    - they are all amazing tools and I want to share as much of my experience
    with them as I can.

    As of February 2024, I've taught Java, Scala, Kotlin and related tech
    (e.g. Cats, ZIO, Spark) to 100000+ students at various levels and I've
    held live training sessions for some of the best companies in the
    industry, including Adobe and Apple. I've also taught university students
    who now work at Google and Facebook (among others), I've held Hour of Code
    for 7-year-olds and I've taught more than 35000 kids to code.

    I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science and I wrote my Bachelor and
    Master theses on Quantum Computation. Before starting to learn
    programming, I won medals at international Physics competitions.
