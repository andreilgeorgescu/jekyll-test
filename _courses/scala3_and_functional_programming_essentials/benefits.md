## After this course, you'll be able to:

- understand Scala in production environments and in any project
- expand your existing object-oriented concepts to a new mindset with immutable values
- think code differently with functional programming
- write powerful code very quickly: 1-2 lines of Scala code enough for 50 lines of Java
- contribute to products and open-source projects written in Scala
- write applications in Scala from scratch
- quickly learn any Scala framework and library: Spark, Cats/Cats Effect, ZIO, Pekko and many others

## Skills you'll get:

- Lasting comfort with the Scala language
  - think code differently with values and expressions
  - use blocks of code as expressions
  - write compact code with recursion
  - master the 2 recursion techniques
  - use the 3 string interpolation techniques in different scenarios
  - use the compiler's type inference effectively
- Extended object-oriented concepts
  - immutable values
  - the 3 method notations for expressive code
  - singleton patterns in one line of code
  - inheritance in Scala
  - abstract classes and traits
  - anonymous classes
  - generics (which are generally poorly understood)
  - exception handling
- Functional programming
  - using functions as values
  - anonymous functions (lambdas)
  - the underscore notation and alternative syntax
  - higher-order functions
  - collections
  - map, flatMap, filter
- Scala-only features
  - pattern matching
  - variance (introduction)
  - for-comprehensions
  - all with live runnable examples and practiced with exercises.

## Plus some extra perks:
- You'll have access to the entire code I write on camera (2000+ LOC)
- You'll be invited to our private Slack room where I'll share latest updates, discounts, talks, conferences, and recruitment opportunities
- You'll have access to the takeaway slides
