## Think differently.

If you're reading this, you probably know already: Scala is one of the most powerful languages on the JVM and is behind some of the best libraries and frameworks for big data processing (Spark), distributed & fault-tolerant computing (Akka/Pekko), streaming (Kafka, Akka/Pekko Streams), effect systems (Cats Effect, ZIO) and many others.

Scala has seen huge demand in recent years, has [some of the best-paid engineering positions](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#work-_-salary-and-experience-by-language), and is just plain fun. I know you can't verify the fun for yourself right now, but I personally hardly know anyone who has tasted Scala and then came back to Java out of their own free will. I also have a stadium of 100000+ students (as of Feb 2024) who took my courses and say the same thing.
